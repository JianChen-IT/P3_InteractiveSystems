Hi,

This project includes a very basic game using PoseNet, which consists in using your "nose" to control a UFO and
collect all the coins. Additionally, I added a menu, a quit button, some background music and music effects
to make the experience a bit more realistic.

If there is any issue please contact me: jian.chen01@estudiant.upf.edu
